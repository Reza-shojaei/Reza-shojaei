## Hi there 👋

About Me
Hello! I'm Reza Shojaei, an Embedded Systems Engineer passionate about IoT, microcontrollers, and hardware design. I specialize in firmware development using Embedded C and have hands-on experience with STM32 and Arduino platforms. My projects often integrate GPS/GSM modules and web interfaces – for example, I built a GPS tracking system on an STM32F103 MCU with a SIM808 GSM/GPS module

. I also developed an Arduino Uno–based GPS tracker using the SIM808 module that logs location data to a website
github.com
. Outside of coding, I enjoy designing and laying out PCBs (using tools like Altium Designer) to support these embedded projects.
Skills
🔧 Embedded C: Extensive firmware development in C (e.g. my STM32 GPS tracker project is ~98% C code
github.com
).
🚀 STM32 Microcontrollers: Experience with STM32F103 (ARM Cortex-M) and related HAL libraries
github.com
.
📐 PCB Design: Skilled in schematic capture and PCB layout for custom electronics.
🎛 Altium Designer: Proficient in using Altium Designer for professional PCB design and documentation.
Notable Projects
stm32-sim808-gps-tracker — GPS tracking system using STM32F103 and SIM808 modules
github.com
. This project initializes the SIM808 over UART, obtains GPS fixes, and sends location data to a web server via HTTP every 10 seconds, with debug output on UART.
sim808_gps_tracker — Arduino UNO GPS tracker with SIM808
github.com
. The Arduino code reads GPS coordinates and uses the SIM808’s GPRS to post data to a PHP/JavaScript web page, enabling real-time map tracking of the device.
